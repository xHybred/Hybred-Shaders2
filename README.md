### Info

Motion Sharp: Dynamically adjusts the strength of the sharpening filter based on movement to help combat the motion blur of TAA

RCAS: Robust CAS is AMD's modified version of CAS that was made specifically for FSR upscaling. This version of CAS claims to be more accurate. Good at combating upscaling related blur

AA Shaders: All shaders ending in AA stand for anti-aliasing. These are all anti-aliasing shaders which can be used for games that don't have good anti-aliasing so you want to replace it with ReShade's


### Credits & Disclaimer

With the exception of Asymmetric Sampling AA created by Hybred, these are ReShade shaders either forked from other ReShade authors then tweaked and/or repurposed, or they are from from AMD/NVIDIA and were ported to ReShade.

Any code belonging to AMD/NVIDIA or to the other ReShade authors deserve full credit for their constributions no matter how much the source material was modified. This is a secondary respotory since it contains other peoples code, for my main directory with Shaders made 100% by myself visit: https://github.com/xHybred/Hybred-Shaders
