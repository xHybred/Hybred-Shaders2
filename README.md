**Inspiration:** All code in this shader is original however the inspiration for the shader was from [ShaderToy Stochastic anti-aliasing](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mtXcDN) & [Github Gaussian anti-aliasing](https://github.com/bburrough/GaussianAntialiasing), the reason I use the word inspired specifically is because recreating these effects in ReShade are impossible, at least not without an addon so my version is far too different to be called the same or to do these versions justice.
