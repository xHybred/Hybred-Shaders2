### Credits & Disclaimer

With the exception of Asymmetric Sampling AA created by Hybred, these are ReShade shaders either forked from other ReShade authors then tweaked and/or repurposed, or they are from from AMD/NVIDIA and were ported to ReShade.

Any code belonging to AMD/NVIDIA or to the other ReShade authors deserve full credit for their constributions no matter how much the source material was modified. This is a secondary respotory since it contains other peoples code, for my main directory with Shaders made 100% by myself visit: https://github.com/xHybred/Hybred-Shaders
